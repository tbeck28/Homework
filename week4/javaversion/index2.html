            <pre>

            From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
            I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
            I hosted parties and starved my body
            Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
            The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
            My friends from home don't know what to say
            I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
            And I saw something they can't take away
            'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
            Everything you lose is a step you take
            So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
            You've got no reason to be afraid

            <pre>

            I'm gonna leave the past behind, I've had enough, I'm breaking free
            No pressing stop, erase, rewind that chain of thought that followed me
            I've put my money where my mouth is for the first time in my life
            I've made mistakes but I believe that everything was worth the fight
            'Cause in the end, the road is long but only 'cause it makes you strong
            It's filled with peaks and twists and turns
            Sometimes you have to learn to forget about it
